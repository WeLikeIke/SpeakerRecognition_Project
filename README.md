# SpeakerRecognition_Project

authors: Lorenzo Tibaldi & Arezou Ranjbarpour Maralani

The python code in the .ipynb file has been tested on Google Collaboratory.

To execute it correctly just upload it to Google drive, 
during execution one cell will ask to select from your machine the .zip that contains the sound files,
That file is the SoundData.zip file that is provided in this repository alongside the code and the .pdf Report.
